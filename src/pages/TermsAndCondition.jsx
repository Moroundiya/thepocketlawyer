                            an online sign-up flow, which identifies the Service to which you have
                            subscribed, additional subscription terms, and the fees payable by you to
                            ThePocketLawyers for that Service. By subscribing to the Service, you may
                            access and use the Service for the purpose of managing your legal practice.

                            any modification of the Services.

                            customers. As a result, we may need to change these Terms of Service from

                            revised Terms of Service will supersede prior versions. Unless we say
                            otherwise, changes will be effective upon the “Last Updated” date located at
                            the top of this page. We agree that changes cannot be retroactive. We will
                            provide you advance notice of any material changes to these Terms of
                            Service. For any other changes, we will publish the revised Terms of Service
                            and update the “Last Updated” date above. We hope that you will continue to
                            use our Services, but if any changes materially impact you or your business
                            and you object to any changes, you may terminate your subscription to the

                            bankrupt, liquidated or is dissolved, or ceases substantially all of its business.
                            Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may terminate your subscription to the
                            Services immediately in the event of your material breach of these Terms of
                            Service, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Upon termination of your
                            subscription, you will immediately discontinue all use of the Services, cease to
                            represent that you are a user of the Services, and destroy all our Confidential

                            Information (as defined in Section 9 below) in your possession. Neither party
                            will be liable for any damages resulting from a valid termination of any
                            subscription(s) to Services; provided, however, that termination will not affect
                            any claim arising prior thereto. <br /><br />
                            6.3 Handling of Your Data in the Event of Termination. <br /><br /> You agree that
                            following expiration or termination of any of your subscriptions to the Services,
                            we may immediately deactivate the affected Services and that, following a
                            reasonable period, we may delete your account and data. However, in the
                            event that the Services are terminated by us, we will grant you temporary,
                            limited access to the Services, not to exceed thirty (30) days, for the sole
                            purpose of permitting you to retrieve your proprietary data, provided that you
                            have paid in full all undisputed amounts owed to us. You further agree that we
                            will not be liable to you or to any third party for any termination of your access
                            to the Services or deletion of your data, provided that we are in compliance
                            with the terms of this Section 6.3.

                            7. Fees. <br /><br />
                            7.1 Service Fees.<br /><br /> You will pay certain non-refundable fees for the Services in
                            the amount set forth in the online sign-up flow (the “Service Fees”) and
                            according to the billing frequency stated therein. Service Fees are due and
                            payable on the date of the invoice. Service Fees are charged on a per
                            authorized user basis. We may increase Service Fees from time to time by
                            providing you with no less than thirty (30) days advance notice; provided,
                            however, the Service Fees for any Service subject to a fixed term, will only be
                            increased at the time of renewal of your subscription to such Service. Service
                            Fees are non-refundable if you terminate your subscription early.<br /><br />
                            7.2 Billing.<br /><br /> All subscriptions to the Service come with an initial free trial period.
                            If you do not provide your credit/debit card information (“Card Details”) to
                            ThePocketLawyers within the free trial period, your account will be suspended
                            and may only be reactivated by submission of valid Card Details.
                            ThePocketLawyers will have no responsibility for any loss of access to or use
                            of the Services or your data or other information stored in or by the Services
                            during such suspension period. If you provide valid Card Details before the
                            end of your free trial, and have elected to continue with a paid plan, you will
                            be billed either monthly (at the end of the trial period) or annually, at your
                            option. Regardless of your billing cycle, there are no refunds or credits for (i)
                            partial months or years of Services, (ii) users with their authorization revoked
                            from your account, or (iii) unused time with an open account. In order to treat

                            all of our customers equally, no exceptions will be made. <br /><br />For any changes to
                            your plan (e.g., different billing cycles, additional authorized users, etc.), your
                            credit/debit card will be charged the new rate on your next billing cycle;
                            provided, however, if you elect to add additional authorized users to your
                            account prior to the date of renewal for your Services (the date you add
                            additional authorized users being referred to herein as the, “User Add Date”),
                            the Service Fee applicable to such additional users will be prorated as of the
                            User Add Date and your credit/debit card will be charged such prorated
                            amount on the User Add Date. Additional charges or increased fees may
                            apply on a going forward basis for customers with an exceptionally high
                            number of authorized users, an unusually high monthly ticket rate per agent,
                            or extraordinary usage of bandwidth, in which case we will notify you in
                            advance to provide you with a reasonable opportunity to modify your use of
                            the Service or terminate your subscription to avoid any additional charges or
                            increased fees.<br /><br />
                            7.3 Additional Fees. <br /><br />You may incur certain other non-refundable fees or
                            charges for your use of the Services, including certain value-added services,
                            in addition to those fees set forth in the online sign-up flow (the “Additional
                            Fees”). Any Additional Fees will be set forth in the additional online sign-up
                            flow for such service.<br /><br />
                            7.4 Late Payments. <br /><br />You acknowledge that your failure to pay any Service
                            Fees or Additional Fees when due may result in suspension or termination of
                            your subscription to the Service. If you fail to pay any of the fees or charges
                            due hereunder, ThePocketLawyers reserves the right to, among other things,
                            engage an attorney or a collections agency to collect the delinquent fees and
                            charges. You agree to pay all fees and costs incurred by ThePocketLawyers
                            in connection with the collection of such delinquent amounts, including without
                            limitation, any and all court and related costs, attorneys’ and/or collections
                            agencies’ fees plus interest in an amount equal to the lesser of 1.0% per
                            month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.<br /><br />
                            7.5 Taxes.<br /><br /> You are responsible for all sales tax, use tax, value added taxes,
                            withholding taxes and any other similar taxes and charge of any kind imposed
                            by federal, state or local governmental entity on the transactions contemplated
                            by these Terms of Service. When we have the legal obligation to pay or
                            collect taxes for which you are responsible pursuant to this Section, the
                            appropriate amount will be invoiced to and paid by you unless you provide us
                            with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing
                            authority.<br /><br />

                            8. Representations and Warranties; Disclaimer.<br /><br />
                            8.1 Representations and Warranties. You represent and warrant that (i) you
                            have all necessary authority to enter into and perform your obligations under
                            these Terms of Service without the consent of any third party or breach of any
                            contract or agreement with any third party; and (ii) you will use the Services
                            only for lawful purposes in accordance with these Terms of Service and any
                            and all applicable ThePocketLawyers policies and guidelines made available

                            8.2 Disclaimer of Warranties. <br /><br />TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
                            APPLICABLE LAW, WE MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
                            WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, IN

                            YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY IS TO STOP USING THE

                            10.1 Our Indemnification.<br /><br /> We agree to defend, indemnify, and hold you
                            harmless from and against all claims brought or threatened against you by a
                            third party alleging that a provision of the Services as permitted hereunder
                            infringes or misappropriates a third party copyright, trade secret, trademark or
                            patent (“Infringement Claim”). If your use of the Services has become, or in
                            our opinion is likely to become, the subject of any Infringement Claim, we
                            may, at our option and expense: (i) procure for you the right to continue using
                            the Services as set forth herein; (ii) modify the Services to make them non-
                            infringing; or (iii) if the foregoing options are not reasonably practicable,
                            terminate these Terms of Service and refund you any unused pre-paid
                            Service Fees. This Section 10.1 states your exclusive remedy for any claim by
                            a third party alleging that the use of the Services as permitted hereunder
                            infringes or misappropriates a third party copyright, trade secret, trademark or
                            patent. The indemnification obligations in this Section will survive termination
                            or expiration of your subscription to the Services.<br /><br />
                            10.2. Limitations.<br /><br /> We have no liability or obligation with respect to any costs or
                            damages claimed under Section 10.1 if the Infringement Claim arises out of or
                            is in any manner attributable to (i) any modification of any Services by you (or
                            any of your authorized users), or (ii) use of Services in combination with
                            services and products not provided by ThePocketLawyers if such infringement

                            would have been avoided without such modification or combination, or (iii) our
                            compliance with your designs or instructions(each an “Excluded Claim”).<br /><br />
                            10.3 Your Indemnification.<br /><br /> You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold us and
                            all our affiliates, employees, officers, directors, contractors, agents, licensors,
                            successors and assigns harmless from any and all claims, judgments,
                            awards, demands, suits, proceedings, investigations, damages, costs,
                            expenses, losses, and any other liabilities (including reasonable attorneys’
                            fees, court costs and expenses) arising out of or relating to (i) your use of the
                            Services in violation of these Terms of Service, (ii) an Excluded Claim, (iii) any
                            actual or alleged breach by you of any representation, warranty, covenant or
                            obligation under these Terms of Service, or (iv) your gross negligence or
                            willful misconduct. Your indemnification obligations under this Section 10.3 will
                            survive any termination or expiration of your subscription to the Services.<br /><br />
                            10.4 Conditions of Indemnification.<br /><br /> The indemnification obligations under this
                            Section 10 above are conditioned upon (i) the indemnified party notifying the
                            indemnifying party promptly in writing upon knowledge of any claim for which
                            it may be entitled to indemnification hereunder; (ii) to the extent applicable, the
                            indemnified party ceasing use of the claimed infringing Services upon receipt
                            of notice of an Infringement Claim; (iii) the indemnified party permitting
                            indemnifying party to have the sole right to control the defense and settlement
                            of any such claim (provided that the indemnifying party may not settle any
                            claim without the indemnified party’s consent unless the settlement
                            unconditionally releases the indemnified party from all liability); (iv) the
                            indemnified party providing reasonable assistance to the indemnifying party,
                            at the indemnifying party’s expense, in the defense of such claim; (v) the
                            indemnified party not entering into any settlement agreement or otherwise
                            settling any such claim without indemnifying party’s express prior written
                            consent or request (except as set forth in (iii) above); and (vi) the indemnified
                            party complying with any settlement or court order made in connection with
                            the claim (e.g., related to the future use of any infringing materials). For clarity,
                            the indemnified party may participate in the defense or settlement of a claim
                            with counsel of its own choice and at its own expense.<br /><br />
                            11. Limitation on Liability. <br /><br />EXCEPT IN CONNECTION WITH EITHER

                            DAMAGE THAT IS NOT REASONABLY FORESEEABLE.<br /><br />

                            12. Data Protection. <br /><br />You will comply with all applicable privacy, data
                            protection, anti-spam and other laws, rules, regulations and guidelines relating
                            to protection, collection, use and distribution of Personally Identifiable
                            Information (as defined below) of any person. If required by applicable data
                            protection legislation or other law or regulation, you will inform third parties
                            that you are providing their Personally Identifiable Information to us for
                            processing and will ensure that any required third parties have given their
                            consent to such disclosure and processing. “Personally Identifiable
                            Information” means any information that can be associated with or traced to
                            any individual, including an individual’s name, address, telephone number, e-
                            mail address, credit card information, social security number or other similar
                            specific factual information, regardless of the media on which such information
                            is stored (e.g., on paper or electronically).<br /><br />
                            13. Ownership Disputes. <br /><br />Ownership of a database associated with the
                            Services is sometimes disputed between one or more parties. While we will
                            have no obligation to do so, we reserve the right, at any time and in our sole
                            discretion, with or without notice to you, to determine rightful database
                            ownership and to transfer a database to the rightful owner. If we can’t

                            reasonably determine the rightful owner, we reserve the right to suspend
                            access to a database until the disputing parties reach a resolution. We also
                            may request joint instructions or certain documentation from the disputing
                            parties, such as a government-issued photo ID, a credit card invoice or a
                            business license, to help determine the rightful owner.<br /><br />
                            14. Customer Interactions. <br /><br />We frequently engage with our customers, and
                            may engage with our customers’ customers or other third parties related to
                            our customers, to understand how they interact with our Services and how to
                            better develop our Services to meet their collective and ever-evolving needs.
                            While transparency and candor are key to that process, you acknowledge and
                            agree that you will not improperly use or disclose to us any confidential
                            information or trade secrets of any third parties, and will not breach any
                            obligation of confidentiality that you may have to any third party. You further
                            acknowledge and agree that no jointly owned intellectual property shall be
                            created as a consequence of our customer or third party engagement process
                            or practices, and that ThePocketLawyers owns all right, title and interest in
                            and to its intellectual property.<br /><br />

                            15. General Provisions. <br /><br />
                            15.1 Independent Parties. <br /><br />No joint venture, partnership, agency or
                            employment relationship exists between you and ThePocketLawyers. You are
                            solely responsible for managing your employees and for any and all
                            compensation, taxes, benefits and liabilities to your employees and any of
                            your other representatives or service providers.<br /><br />
                            15.2 Assignment. <br /><br />You will not assign or transfer the Services or any of your
                            rights and/or obligations under these Terms of Service without our prior
                            written consent. We may without restriction assign or transfer our rights and/or
                            obligation hereunder, at our sole discretion. Subject to the foregoing, these
                            Terms of Service will bind to the parties’ respective successors and assigns.<br /><br />
                            15.3 Force Majeure.<br /><br /> No failure, delay or default in performance of any
                            obligation of a party will constitute an event of default or breach of these
                            Terms of Service to the extent that such failure to perform, delay or default
                            arises out of a cause that is beyond the control and without negligence of
                            such party, including (but not limited to) natural disasters (e.g. lightning,
                            earthquakes, hurricanes, floods); wars, riots, terrorist activities, and civil
                            commotions; a local exchange carrier’s activities, and other acts of third
                            parties; explosions and fires; embargoes, strikes, and labor disputes;
                            governmental decrees; failures of telecommunications providers or internet

                            service providers; and failures of third party suppliers, service providers or
                            vendors. The party affected by such cause shall take all reasonable actions to
                            minimize the consequences of any such cause.<br /><br />
                            15.4 Applicable Law.<br /><br /> These Terms of Service and any dispute arising out of or
                            relating to the Services and/or these Terms of Service will be interpreted in
                            accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic Nigeria, without regard to
                            conflict-of-law provisions. All disputes arising out of or related to these Terms
                            of Service shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Lagos
                            state courts located in Nigeria, Lagos and federal courts of the Central District
                            of Lagos (unless we both agree to some other location). We each hereby
                            expressly consent to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of such courts.<br /><br />
                            15.5 Notices. <br /><br />You agree that we will provide notices, statements and other
                            messages to you in the following ways: (1) within the Service, or (2) to the
                            contact information you last provided us (e.g., e-mail, mobile number, physical
                            address, etc.). You agree to keep your contact information up to date.<br /><br />
                            15.6 No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.<br /><br /> Either party’s failure to enforce any
                            right or provision under these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of
                            that right or provision. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms of Service,
                            the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms of
                            Service are in addition to (and not exclusive of) any other remedies permitted
                            at law or in equity.<br /><br />
                            15.7 Severability.<br /><br /> If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid,
                            then that provision will be limited or eliminated by the court to the minimum
                            extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service will
                            remain in full force and effect.<br /><br />
                            15.8 Entire Agreement.<br /><br /> These Terms of Service and (i) the terms you agree to
                            during the online sign-up flow, (ii) the ThePocketLawyers Payment Terms, (iii)
                            the ThePocketLawyers Website Terms, and (iv) any other policies applicable
                            to your use of the Services that we make available to you (each of which is

                            entire agreement between you and us, and supersede all prior and

                            ThePocketLawyers with respect to the Services. You acknowledge and agree
                            that your agreement to these Terms of Service is not contingent upon the
                            delivery of any future functionality or features not specified herein or in an
                            online sign-up flow or dependent upon any oral or written, public or private
                            comments made by us with respect to future functionality or features for the

                            Services. In the event of any conflict between the provisions in these Terms of
                            Service and any online sign-up flows (or addendums thereto), the terms of
                            such online sign-up flows (or addendums thereto) will prevail.<br /><br />
                            15.9 Export.<br /><br /> Both parties agree to comply with applicable Nigerian export and
                            import laws and regulations. You will not permit your users to access or use
                            the Services in violation of any Nigerian export embargo, prohibition or
                            restriction.<br /><br />
                            15.10 Third Party Services.<br /><br /> The Services or our website may contain links to
                            other sites, services, and products provided by third parties, which may
                            include our affiliates or subsidiaries. Such links are provided for your

                            from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third party websites
                            or services found within the Services, you do so entirely at your own risk and
                            subject to the terms and conditions of use for such websites or services.<br /><br />

                            may from time to time request you provide updated information and
                            supporting documentation to confirm your then-current business and financial

                            status, which you shall deliver to us within three (3) business days of our
                            request. Any failure to provide such information and supporting documentation
                            within a timely manner or failure to satisfy our then-current underwriting
                            criteria (as determined in our sole discretion) will be deemed a material
                            breach of this Agreement and result in the termination of your right to use the
                            ACH Services.<br /><br />
                            1.2 Definitions.<br /><br />

                            our third-party payment processor for ACH Services.
                            NACHA: the National Automated Clearing House Association.
                            NACHA Rules: The then-current rules, regulations and procedural guidelines
                            published by NACHA and/or all regional payment alliances associated with
                            NACHA.
                            Originating Depository Financial Institution or ODFI: The financial institution
                            that receives the Entry from JHA and transmits the Entry to its ACH operator
                            for transmittal to a Receiving Depository Financial Institution for debit or credit
                            to your or your Customer’s account, as these terms are further defined in the
                            NACHA Rules.
                            Receiving Depository Financial Institution or RDFI: A financial institution
                            qualified to receive ACH Entries.

                            have established for JHA’s access and use to settle financial payment

                            1.3 Transmittal of Entries; Timing. <br /><br />You hereby authorize us to initiate ACH
                            credits and debits and adjustments to the Authorized Account(s). This
                            authorization will remain in effect after termination of this Agreement until all of
                            your obligations to us and/or JHA have been paid in full. Confirmation from us
                            of a credit or debit ACH transaction does not constitute a warranty that you
                            will be paid for the transaction.
                            ACH files received by the processing deadline (imposed by the ODFI and the
                            ACH operator) will be transmitted that day to the Federal Reserve Bank for
                            settlement on the effective Entry day. Files received after the deadline will be

                            Notwithstanding the foregoing, delivery of funds may take up to five (5)
                            business days to allow Reject/Return codes from the RDFI.<br /><br />
                            1.4 Authorizations. <br /><br />We reserve the right to cease providing you the ACH
                            Service if we (in our sole discretion) determine that your use of the ACH
                            Services results in an unacceptable volume of rejects or Returns. Additionally,
                            we reserve the right to determine adjustment of fees, potential reserves, or
                            terminate your right to use the ACH Service if we (in our sole discretion)
                            determine that other factors may affect the risk of fraud or Merchant instability.<br /><br />
                            1.5 Recoupment and Set-Off. <br /><br />You shall immediately reimburse JHA for any
                            returns or shortfalls that occur in your Settlement Account. JHA reserves the
                            right to delay the availability of funds for deposit without prior written notices to
                            you if, in its sole discretion, JHA deems itself at financial or relative risk for any
                            and all ACH Services performed under this Agreement.
                            You hereby acknowledge and agree that JHA shall have a right of setoff
                            against: (i) any amounts JHA would otherwise be obligated to deposit into
                            your account, and (ii) any other amounts JHA may owe you under this
                            Agreement.<br /><br />

                            1.6.1 <br /><br />We represent and warrant to you that our ACH Services will be

                            your identity as a condition of providing you the credit card payment services
                            (the “Card Services”). Such information may include a government issued

                            employer verification number (EIN), valid Nigerian credit card, a verified bank

                            your Card Services account in our sole discretion. By accepting these terms,
                            you specifically authorize us to request identity verifying information about you
                            from third parties, including without limitation, a consumer report that contains

                            institutions. This includes sharing information<br /><br /> (i) about your transactions for
                            regulatory or compliance purposes, <br /> (ii) for use in connection with the

                            card use.<br /><br />

                            Account: A Nigerian bank account or accounts as designated by you in your
                            written application for the Card Services and/or additional bank accounts
                            designated by you and communicated to us in writing.
                            Card Brands: Collectively, payment cards bearing the trademarks of
                            MasterCard Incorporated (“MasterCard”), Visa Inc. (“Visa”), Discover Financial

                            Services (“Discover”), and the American Express Company (“American
                            Express”).
                            Association: VISA, MasterCard, Discover or American Express.
                            Customer: For purposes of this Section 2, your client who submits a payment
                            to you by payment card.
                            Member Bank: A bank that is a member of the Federal Reserve System.
                            Merchant Supplier: A third party other than Processor used by you in
                            connection with the Card Services received hereunder, including but not
                            limited to, software providers, equipment providers, and/or third party
                            processors.
                            Processor: Worldpay, LLC and its designated Member Bank that is our third-
                            party payment processor for the Card Services.<br /><br />
                            2.3 Acceptable Cards.<br /><br /> The Card Services allow you to accept payments
                            initiated with the Card Brands. We may remove or add cards that we accept at
                            any time without prior notice. We will only process cards that receive an
                            authorization from the applicable Card Brand or card issuer.<br /><br />
                            2.4 Our Role. <br /><br />We are only a payment service provider and not a bank and do
                            not offer banking or money service business services as defined by the United
                            States Department of Treasury. As a merchant payment processor, we merely
                            collect and relay information generated in connection with these payments. To
                            serve in this role, we must enter into agreements with Card Brands, other
                            processors and banks. These third parties may require that our customers
                            enter into an agreement with Processor. If you are such a user, we will
                            provide you a “Merchant Services Agreement for Sub-Merchants” that you
                            must execute in order to use the Card Services.<br /><br />
                            2.5 Applicable Card Brand Rules &amp; Laws. <br /><br />The Card Brands require that you

                            You are prohibited from <br /><br /> (i) assessing a surcharge for the use of a card in

                            transaction. <br />
                            The Card Brand Rules may contain provisions that affect your legal rights,
                            including arbitration agreements, jury and class action waivers, and limitations

                            initiated with Card Brands you agree to such provisions. <br />
                            If you permit recurring transactions, you must <br />(i) obtain your customer’s
                            consent to periodically charge the customer on a recurring basis for the
                            services purchased; <br />(ii) retain this permission for the duration of the recurring

                            frequency of the recurring charge, the duration of time during which such
                            charges may be made and the amount or range of amounts that may be
                            charged. You must not submit any recurring transaction after receiving: <br />(a) a
                            cancellation notice from your customer (so long as such notice was timely
                            provided at least three (3) days prior to the transaction date); or <br />(b) notice
                            from us, Processor or any Card Brand that the Card is not to be honored. In
                            your transaction data, you should include an electronic indicator that the
                            transaction is a recurring transaction. You will promptly notify us in the event
                            you learn that cardholder information has changed with respect to a customer
                            that is currently subject to recurring charges.<br /><br />
                            You may not suggest or require that your customers waive their right to
                            dispute a card payment transaction.
                            You represent, warrant and covenant to comply with all the Card Brand Rules
                            and all applicable state, federal, and local laws, rules, and regulations

                            by the Card Brands may be terminated and you and the individual owners of

                            evidence of tax exemption that is satisfactory to ThePocketLawyers. In the

                            transaction fees from your designated Account. Your authorization permits us

                            transactions submitted through the Service. Once your bank account
                            information is verified, Processor will automatically deposit your money in your

                            deposited until the transaction is deemed complete. Transactions will be
                            deemed complete when Processor has received or sent the funds and when
                            Processor or the designated financial institutions have accepted the

                            entity.<br /><br />

                            2.13 Your Account History. <br /><br />When a payment is made to your Account, we will
                            update your Account activity on the Services and provide you a transaction
                            confirmation. The confirmation will serve as your receipt. Summaries of your
                            account activity are available through the Services. Except as required by law,
                            you are solely responsible for <br /><br />(i) compiling and retaining permanent records of
                            all transactions and other data associated with your Account and your use of
                            the Service, and <br />(ii) reconciling all transactional information that is associated
                            with your Account. If you believe that there is an error or unauthorized
                            transaction activity is associated with your Account, you agree to contact us
                            immediately.<br /><br />
                            2.14 Receipts. <br /><br />You must make a written receipt available to your customers
                            for any transaction greater than fifteen dollars ($15.00). You may give your
                            customers the option to receive or decline a written receipt. As a convenience,
                            but not in lieu of a written receipt, you may also offer electronic receipts for
                            delivery through email to your customers.<br /><br />
                            2.15 Customer Service. <br /><br />You are solely responsible for all customer service
                            issues relating to your services, including pricing, order fulfillment, order
                            cancellation by you or customer, returns, refunds and adjustments, rebates,
                            functionality and warranty, technical support, and feedback concerning
                            experiences with your personnel, policies or processes. In performing
                            customer service, you will always present yourself as a separate entity from
                            us.<br /><br />
                            2.16 Refunds and Returns. <br /><br />By accepting payment card transactions through
                            the Service, you agree to process returns of, and provide refunds and
                            adjustments for, your services through your account in accordance with these
                            terms and the Card Brand Rules. Card Brand Rules require that you will <br /><br />(i)
                            maintain a fair return, cancellation or adjustment policy; <br />(ii) disclose your
                            return or cancellation policy to customers at the time of purchase, <br />(iii) not give
                            cash refunds to a customer in connection with a card sale, unless required by
                            law, and <br />(iv) not accept cash or any other item of value for preparing a card
                            sale refund. The amount of the refund/adjustment must include any
                            associated taxes required to be refunded and cannot exceed the amount
                            shown as the total on the original sales data except by the exact amount
                            required to reimburse the customer for postage that the customer paid to
                            return merchandise. Please be aware, if your refund policy prohibits returns or
                            is unsatisfactory to the buyer, you may still receive a chargeback relating to
                            such sales.<br /><br />

                            You can process a refund through your Account up to sixty (60) days from the
                            day you accepted the payment. If your balance is insufficient to cover the
                            refund, we will request your authorization to withdraw up to the requested
                            refund amount from your bank account. Processor will then withdraw the
                            amount you were paid from your bank account, and credit it back into your
                            customer’s card. We and our Processor have no obligation to accept any
                            returns of any of your services on your behalf.<br /><br />
                            2.17 Your Liability for Chargebacks. <br /><br />The amount of a transaction may be
                            reversed or charged back to your account (a “chargeback”) if the transaction<br /><br />
                            (i) is disputed, <br />(ii) is reversed for any reason by the Card Brand, Processor, or
                            a payer’s or our financial institution, <br />(iii) was not authorized or we have any
                            reason to believe that the transaction was not authorized, or <br />(iv) is allegedly
                            unlawful, suspicious, or in violation of these terms.<br /><br />
                            2.18 Our Collection Rights for Chargebacks. <br /><br />Processor may deduct the
                            amount of any chargeback and any associated fees, fines, or penalties
                            assessed by the Card Brand from your Account, any proceeds due to you,
                            your bank account, or other payment instrument registered with us. If you
                            have pending chargebacks, we may delay payouts from your Account.
                            Further, if we reasonably believe that a chargeback is likely with respect to
                            any transaction, Processor may withhold the amount of the potential
                            chargeback from payments otherwise due to you under these terms until such
                            time that:<br /><br /> (i) a chargeback is assessed due to a customer’s complaint, in
                            which case Processor will retain the funds; <br />(ii) the period of time under
                            applicable law or regulation by which the customer may dispute that the
                            transaction has expired; or<br /> (iii) we determine that a chargeback on the
                            transaction will not occur. If we, via our Processor, are unable to recover
                            funds related to a chargeback for which you are liable, you will pay us the full
                            amount of the chargeback immediately upon demand. You agree to pay all
                            costs and expenses, including without limitation attorneys’ fees and other
                            legal expenses, incurred by or on behalf of us in connection with the collection
                            of all account deficit balances unpaid by you. You hereby authorize Processor
                            to charge the amount of daily chargebacks from your Accounts that originally
                            received the relevant payment amounts by making an ACH debit from your
                            Account.<br /><br />
                            2.19 Excessive Chargebacks. <br /><br />If we determine that you are incurring an
                            excessive amount of chargebacks, we may establish controls or conditions
                            governing your account, including without limitation, by <br /><br />(i) establishing new
                            processing fees, <br />(ii) delaying payouts, and<br /> (iii) terminating or suspending the
                            services.

                            2.20 Contesting Chargebacks.<br /><br /> You agree to assist us when requested, at your
                            expense, to investigate any of your transactions processed through the
                            Service. Towards that end, you permit us to share information about a
                            chargeback with the payer, the payer’s financial institution, and your financial
                            institution in order to investigate and/or mediate a chargeback. We will request
                            necessary information from you to contest the chargeback. If the chargeback
                            is contested successfully, we will release the reserved funds to your account.
                            If a chargeback dispute is not resolved in your favor by the Card Brand or
                            issuing bank or you choose not to contest the chargeback, we may recover
                            the chargeback amount and any associated fees as described in these terms.
                            You acknowledge that your failure to assist us in a timely manner when
                            investigating a transaction, including providing necessary documentation
                            within fifteen (15) days of our request, may result in an irreversible
                            chargeback. We reserve the right, upon notice to you, to charge a fee for
                            mediating and/or investigating chargeback disputes.<br /><br />
                            2.21 Our Set-off Rights. <br /><br />To the extent permitted by law, we, and our
                            Processor, may set off against the balances for any obligation you owe us
                            under these terms, including without limitation any chargebacks. Any fees
                            assessed in association with a transaction will be deducted from your
                            designated Account.<br /><br />
                            2.22 Our Processing Errors.<br /><br /> We will attempt to rectify processing errors that
                            we discover. If the error resulted in your receipt of less than the correct
                            amount to which you were entitled, we will credit your account for the
                            difference. If the error results in your receipt of more than the correct amount
                            to which you were entitled, we will debit the extra funds from your account.
                            We will only correct transactions that you process incorrectly if and when you
                            notify us of such an error. Your failure to notify us of a processing error within
                            thirty (30) days of when it first appears on your electronic transaction history
                            will be deemed a waiver of any right to amounts owed to you.<br /><br />
                            2.23 Card Data Security and Access to Cardholder Data. <br /><br />You agree to the
                            confidentiality and security requirements required by the Card Brands
                            including, but not limited to, the following:

                            If and to the extent you elect to accept in-person credit card payments or
                            otherwise gain access to a cardholder’s account number, expiration date, and
                            CVV2 (collectively, “Cardholder Data”), you agree that at all times you will be
                            compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI

                            applicable regulatory bodies.<br /><br />
                            PCI DSS requires that you implement and maintain certain data security
                            policies and procedures. As of the date of this Agreement, PCI DSS mandates
                            that you comply with the following requirements:<br /><br />
                            1. Install and maintain a network firewall to protect Cardholder Data.<br />
                            2. Do not use vendor-supplied defaults for system passwords and other
                            security parameters.<br />
                            3. Protect stored Cardholder Data.<br />

                            6. Develop and maintain secure systems and applications.<br />
                            7. Restrict access to Cardholder Data by business need to know.<br />
                            8. Identify and authenticate access to system components.<br />
                            9. Restrict physical access to Cardholder Data.<br />
                            10. Track and monitor all access to network resources and
                            Cardholder Data.<br />
                            11. Regularly test security systems and processes.<br />

                            As part of the above, you must not, and will ensure that your Merchant
                            Suppliers do not, store any portion of the magnetic-stripe data subsequent to

                            Card Brand Rules or the Bank Rules. You or your Merchant Suppliers must
                            not store CVV2 data at any time. In addition, you agree that you will not<br /><br /> (i) use

                            Cardholder Data for any purpose other than to support card payments for your
                            services, <br />(ii) use the Cardholder Data for any purpose that you know or should
                            know to be fraudulent or in violation of any Card Brand Rules, or <br /> (iii) sell,
                            purchase, provide or exchange in any manner or disclose Cardholder Data to

                            cause all Merchant Suppliers to complete any steps or certifications required
                            by any Association (e.g., registrations, PA-DSS, PCI DSS, audits, etc.). You
                            will cause your Merchant Suppliers to cooperate with Processor in completing
                            any such steps or certifications (if applicable), and in performing any
                            necessary due diligence on such Merchant Supplier. You shall be solely
                            responsible for any and all applicable fees, costs, expenses and liabilities
                            associated with such steps, registrations, and certifications.<br /><br />
                            You shall certify in writing your compliance with PCI DSS promptly upon our
                            request or in accordance with the Card Brand Rules. We have the right to
                            conduct PCI DSS audits, from time to time and at your sole expense,

                            with the terms of this Agreement.
                            In the event you learn or reasonably suspect that Cardholder Data was
                            accessed or retrieved by any unauthorized person or entity, contact us
                            immediately and in no event more than 24 hours after becoming aware of

                            recommended by any such investigation, and <br />(iii) cooperate with us in the

                            into the Terms of Service. Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined
                            below shall have the meaning given in the Terms of Service. In the event of

                            setup and registration or transfer of one domain name if we decide, in our sole
                            discretion, that registration or transfer is necessary to enable the Website
                            Hosting Services. If more than one domain name must be registered or
                            transferred, additional fees may apply. You are responsible for providing
                            materials and reasonable assistance as identified by us for the registration
                            and/or transfer of domain name(s). <br /><br />We will maintain current domain
                            registration as long as you are subscribed to the Website Hosting Services
                            and have paid all applicable fees. As part of the set-up process, we will give
                            you an opportunity to modify the current content of your existing website, if
                            any. We will interact with your current hosting company only if necessary and
                            authorized by you and will not be responsible for any costs incurred to obtain
                            files or other transfer-related costs, all of which shall be your responsibility.<br /><br />

                            text, images and colors; provided, however, you remain solely responsible for<br /><br />

                            monitor or exert editorial control over your Content or any other aspect of your
                            website(s). If we take corrective action because of any possible violation, we

                            5.2 Handling of Data upon Termination. <br /><br />Subscribers agree that following
                            expiration or termination of any subscriptions to the “Advanced” tier of
                            ThePocketLawyers Services, and thus the Drive Application, we may
                            immediately deactivate access to the Drive Application and that, following a
                            reasonable period, we may delete the Drive Application account and data.
                            However, in the event that the Drive Application is terminated by us, we will
                            grant you temporary, limited access to the Drive Application, not to exceed
                            thirty (30) days, for the sole purpose of permitting you to retrieve your
                            proprietary data, provided that you have paid in full all undisputed amounts
                            owed to us. You further agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third
                            party for any termination of a Subscriber’s access to the Drive Application or
                            deletion of the Subscriber’s data, provided that we are in compliance with the
                            terms of this Section 5.2. <br /><br />
